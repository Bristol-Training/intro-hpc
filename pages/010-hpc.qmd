title: What are HPC Systems?
---

High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are specialized computing environments designed to solve computationally intensive problems that require significant processing power, memory, or storage resources.

## Key Characteristics of HPC Systems

**Parallel Processing**: HPC systems typically consist of multiple compute nodes (individual computers) connected via high-speed networks, allowing tasks to be distributed across many processors simultaneously.

**Shared Resources**: Unlike personal computers, HPC systems are shared among multiple users, requiring job scheduling systems to manage resource allocation fairly and efficiently.

**Specialized Hardware**: HPC clusters often include:

- Multiple CPU cores per node
- Large amounts of RAM (64GB-1TB+ per node)
- High-speed interconnects
- Specialized processors (GPUs for certain workloads)
- High-performance storage systems

**Batch Processing**: Most HPC work is submitted as "jobs" to a queue, rather than running interactively.

## When to Use HPC

Consider using HPC systems when your computational tasks involve:

- Long-running calculations
- Large memory requirements
- Parallel processing opportunities
- Large datasets that don't fit on personal computers
